This repository contains what is needed to solve the second assigment in the course "Webbutveckling i ramverket för .NET" ("Webdevelopment with the .NET framework") winter 2018 at [Teknikhögskolan Gothenburg](https://github.com/TeknikhogskolanGothenburg).

# Assignment

The assignment can either be done as a team or an individual:

* Individual version, Swedish [AssignmentIndividual.sv.md](AssignmentIndividual.sv.md)

A github assignment is created and everybody will recive an invite to this, the scrummaster will create the team and the rest of the teammembers joins this team. The team will get a repository containing all code.
